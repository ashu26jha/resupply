# Disclosure: Delayed Accumulation of Governance Voting Power

**Date:** 2025-05-14  
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Unintended voting power delay  
**Status:** Resolved via voter contract replacement

---

## Summary

- An unintended delay on voting power accumulation for stakers was identified due to redundant logic between the original `Voter.sol` [[1]](#References) and `GovStaker.sol` [[2]](#References) contracts.
- The issue, located in the Voter.sol, forces users to unnecessarily wait an additional epoch before receiving their full voting power.
- A patched contract was deployed [[3]](#References) and a governance proposal to migrate has been created.
- No user action is required.
- No funds were ever at risk.

## Technical Overview

- Resupply governance is designed to grant voting power to stakers starting the epoch immediately following their stake.
- The `GovStaker` contract enforces this requirement correctly.
- However, the original `Voter` contract redundantly enforced this requirement by querying vote power at `current_epoch - 1`, having the effect of duplicating the 1 epoch offset.
- As a result, voting power in the original voter is actually based on a user's stake `current_epoch - 2`, which is inconsistent with intended behavior.
- Further, this offset has the drawback of allowing users who have fully unstaked up to nearly two epochs ago to retain voting power.

## Remediation

- A patch was implemented on `Voter.sol`, and new contract was deployed.
- A governance proposal to migrate to the new Voter has been posted.

## Impact

- No funds were ever at risk.
- New voter deployed.
- No user action is required beyond an encouragement to participate in the governance vote to formally migrate the DAO to the new Voter.
- Assuming the proposal passes, any pre-existing proposals on the original voter will remain eligible for execution until the voter replacement is executed on chain.
